# AB-Testing
Which version is better
AB testing, also known as split testing, is a critical business strategy used to compare two versions of a webpage, app, or marketing element to determine which performs better. This approach enables businesses to make data-driven decisions by measuring user interactions, such as click-through rates or conversions, and understanding which version leads to more favorable outcomes. AB testing allows companies to optimize their content, design, or features based on real user behavior, leading to improved user experiences and higher engagement rates. Ultimately, AB testing empowers businesses to refine their strategies and drive better results, thereby enhancing their overall performance and competitiveness
